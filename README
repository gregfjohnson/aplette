Welcome to aplette
------------------
Aplette is a slimmed down, skinny APL interpreter derived from openApl.

On linux, you will need to install bison and libreadline.

For example, on Ubuntu:
    sudo apt-get install libreadline6 libreadline6-dev bison

On Windows, I have tested with cygwin only.  In your cygwin installation,
you will need to include gcc, gnu make, libreadline_devel, and bison.

To build:
	$> ./configure
	$> make

This will build the binary executable source/aplette.

You can test your installation as follows:
	$> cd qa
	$> make


aplette uses an ASCII/APL character mapping dubbed APL-touchtype.

If you can write APL with your eyes closed, you can use
APL-touchtype. "rho" is "R", "iota" is "I", etc. Trig is "O". Log is
"O@*". (APL-touchtype uses "@" instead of backspace, and with that trivial
substitution, all of the APL overstrikes become APL-touchtype ascii.)
