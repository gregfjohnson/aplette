Welcome to aplette
------------------
Aplette is a slimmed down, skinny APL interpreter derived from openApl.

On linux, you will need to install bison and libreadline.

On Windows, I have tested with cygwin only.  In your cygwin installation,
you will need to include gcc, gnu make, libreadline_devel, and bison.

To build:
	$> ./configure
	$> make

This will build the binary executable source/aplette.

You can test your installation as follows:
	$> cd qa
	$> make
