DYNAMIC MEMORY MANAGEMENT
-------------------------
(This file consists of an attempt to analyse the memory
management functions from apl\11.)  

Throughout the client routines, memory is obtained and released
with alloc() and aplfree().  These are wrappers for malloc(3)
and free(3) and include some additional overheads.

The module afreset() is used by ws_clear... this provides the
clue to the overheads.  afreset() is able to clear all dynamic
memory because a linked list of allocated blocks is maintained
by alloc() and aplfree().

The clients which use these functions the most are in the 
../data subdirectory.
