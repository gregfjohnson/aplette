PRINT ROUTINES
--------------
The entry points for most print tasks are ex_print and
ex_hprint.  These call print() which coordinates most of
the real work.  

Stage 1.  The top of the expr_stack is fetch()'ed - so it
stays on the expr_stack and if it is a quad function or
variable, fetch() will convert it into a number.  For
data types, fpt_size() is called with every member of the 
item as an argument.  The goal of this process is to
calculate 4 parameters held in the structure "format" 
Next fpt_adjust() is called to determine the width of 
the print fields - each numeral will subsequently be printed
in an identical field width.

not sure what bidx does!!

Stage 2 - The actual printing.  One bigish loop takes
care of printing all the values in the data space.  
Character and numeric data types are dealt with
differently: character data is handled on the spot,
numeric data requires a call to fpt2char().  After each
value (character or numeral) is printed, a test is
performed to see if a line feed is required.  For
instance: if pagewidth is exceeded or if the end of
a major block (ie "dimension") is reached.

fpt_size(), fpt_adjust() and fpt2char are in the ../format
directory.
